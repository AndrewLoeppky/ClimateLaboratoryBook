<p><strong><em>A hands-on approach to climate physics and climate modeling</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/index.html">Brian E. J. Rose</a>, University at Albany</strong></p>
<p>This will evolve into the textbook for both
<a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2018/">ENV 415: Climate Laboratory</a> and <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2019/">ATM 623: Climate Modeling</a>
at the <a href="https://www.albany.edu">University at Albany</a>.</p>
<p>This book is powered by <a href="https://jupyterbook.org">JupyterBook</a>,
and aims to be all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>self-reproducing</strong> <em>(most figures are self-generating in the notebooks)</em></li>
<li><strong>free</strong> and <strong>open</strong> <em>(permissive license, sources and content available through github)</em></li>
<li><strong>interactive</strong> <em>(integration with JupyterHub and Binder will allow readers to run and modify code examples)</em></li>
<li>a <strong>living document</strong> <em>(content will continue to evolve, and collaboration is welcome)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/">To view the book online, go here</a>.</p>
<p>The JupyterBook source and all book content (mostly <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyter Notebook</a> files)
are all in <a href="https://github.com/brian-rose/ClimateLaboratoryBook">this github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the content is made possible by <a href="https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab">climlab</a>, an open-source
Python toolkit for interactive, process-oriented climate modeling.
<a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/index.html">Brian Rose</a> is the principle developer of climlab as well as the author of this book.</p>
