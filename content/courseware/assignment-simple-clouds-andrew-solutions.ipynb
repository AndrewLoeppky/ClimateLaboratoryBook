    "\n",
    "Consider the two-layer \"leaky greenhouse\" (or grey radiation) model from [these lecture notes](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/elementary-greenhouse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will use this model to investigate the **radiative effects of clouds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds simultaneously **reflect shortwave radiation** and **absorb longwave radiation**. These two effects often oppose each other in nature, and which one is stronger depends (among other things) on whether the clouds are **low** or **high** (i.e. in layer 0 or layer 1).\n",

    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a cloud reflects a fraction $\\alpha_c$ of the shortwave beam incoming from above. $\\alpha_c$ is a number between 0 and 1. Provide a coherent argument (in words, sketches, and/or equations) for why the **shortwave** effects cloud should always be a **cooling** on the surface. Is this cooling effect different if the cloud is low or high? Explain."

There is no altitude dependence to this effect (unless we worry about increasing ice content in higher/colder clouds, which does affect the SW cloud albedo)."
